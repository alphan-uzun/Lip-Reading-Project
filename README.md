# Lip-Reading-Project
There were videos of thousands of Turkish speakers 
saying 10 different words which were gathered from YouTube videos. The purpose 
was to acquire the highest accuracy rate of classification of these videos to these 10 
classes (10 words) using machine learning or deep learning models. This project was 
conducted on python and it involved detailed research on articles for detecting facial
landmarks from images, data pre-processing, feature extraction, deep learning 
models (CNN, LSTM, BiGRU, etc.), neural networks, overfitting, underfitting, 
regularization and related topics. Some models were created that can actually 
achieve lip reading to classify unlabeled data to 10 different classes. These models 
were evaluated and compared with each other to find the most powerful model that 
serves this task. For comparison and adjustment of hyperparameters of the models, 
MlFlow was used that is responsible for keeping track of the hyperparameters. The 
motivation behind this work was to acquire the highest accuracy of lip reading. The 
work done for Lip Reading Project was significant because every engineer in the 
project was focusing on different models, approaches, pre-processing methods etc. 
that could best achieve the lip-reading purpose and in this sense, my work had some 
unique methods and it helped them to get the results of various models that can be 
compared and evaluated with other engineersâ€™ approaches.

A technical report was also included that summarizes the findings. This project was
conducted in an internship, therefore this report contains some parts related to
the company or my mentors. The report also gives brief information about another
AI project which is "Avionic Maintenance Prediction".
